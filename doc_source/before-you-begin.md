Before you use Kinesis Data Firehose for the first time, complete the following tasks\.

**Topics**
+ [Sign Up for AWS](#setting-up-sign-up-for-aws)
+ [Optional: Download Libraries and Tools](#setting-up-downloads)

## Sign Up for AWS<a name="setting-up-sign-up-for-aws"></a>

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including Kinesis Data Firehose\. You are charged only for the services that you use\.

If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task\. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)\.

## Optional: Download Libraries and Tools<a name="setting-up-downloads"></a>

The following libraries and tools will help you work with Kinesis Data Firehose programmatically and from the command line: 
+ The [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/) is the basic set of operations that Kinesis Data Firehose supports\.
+ The AWS SDKs for [Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/firehose/), [Java](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/getting-started/java/), [\.NET](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/getting-started/net/), [Node\.js](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/getting-started/nodejs/), [Python](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/getting-started/python/), and [Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/getting-started/ruby/) include Kinesis Data Firehose support and samples\.

  If your version of the AWS SDK for Java does not include samples for Kinesis Data Firehose, you can also download the latest AWS SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/tree/master/src/samples)\.
+ The [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/) supports Kinesis Data Firehose\. The AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts\.
