For more information, see [Index Rotation for the Amazon ES Destination](basic-deliver.md#es-index-rotation)\.  
** **Type** **  
The Amazon ES type name to be used when indexing data to your Amazon ES cluster\. For Elasticsearch 6\.x, there can be only one type per index\. If you try to specify a new type for an existing index that already has another type, Kinesis Data Firehose returns an error during runtime\.   
For Elasticsearch 7\.x, leave this field empty\.  
** **Retry duration** **  
Time duration \(0–7200 seconds\) for Kinesis Data Firehose to retry if an index request to your Amazon ES cluster fails\. Kinesis Data Firehose retries every 5 minutes until the retry duration ends\. If you set the retry duration to 0 \(zero\) seconds, Kinesis Data Firehose does not retry upon an index request failure\.  
** **Destination VPC connectivity** **  
If your Amazon ES domain is in a private VPC, use this section to specify that VPC\. Also specify the subnets and subgroups that you want Kinesis Data Firehose to use when it sends data to your Amazon ES domain\. You can use the same security group that the Amazon ES domain uses or different ones\. If you specify different security groups, ensure that they allow outbound HTTPS traffic to the Amazon ES domain's security group\. Also ensure that the Amazon ES domain's security group allows HTTPS traffic from the security groups that you specified when you configured your delivery stream\. If you use the same security group for both your delivery stream and the Amazon ES domain, make sure the security group's inbound rule allows HTTPS traffic\. For more information about security group rules, see [Security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SecurityGroupRules) in the Amazon VPC documentation\.  
**Backup mode**  
You can choose to either back up failed records only or all records\. If you choose failed records only, any data that Kinesis Data Firehose can't deliver to your Amazon ES cluster or that your Lambda function can't transform is backed up to the specified S3 bucket\. If you choose all records, Kinesis Data Firehose backs up all incoming source data to your S3 bucket concurrently with data delivery to Amazon ES\. For more information, see [Data Delivery Failure Handling](basic-deliver.md#retry) and [Data Transformation Failure Handling](data-transformation.md#data-transformation-failure-handling)\.  
**Backup S3 bucket**  
An S3 bucket you own that is the target of the backup data\. Create a new S3 bucket, or choose an existing bucket that you own\.  
**Backup S3 bucket prefix**  
\(Optional\) To use the default prefix for Amazon S3 objects, leave this option blank\. Kinesis Data Firehose automatically uses a prefix in "`YYYY/MM/dd/HH`" UTC time format for delivered Amazon S3 objects\. You can add to the start of this prefix\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Object Name Format](basic-deliver.md#s3-object-name)\.
