# Monitoring Kinesis Data Firehose Using CloudWatch Metrics<a name="monitoring-with-cloudwatch-metrics"></a>

Kinesis Data Firehose integrates with Amazon CloudWatch metrics so that you can collect, view, and analyze CloudWatch metrics for your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams\. For example, you can monitor the `IncomingBytes` and `IncomingRecords` metrics to keep track of data ingested into Kinesis Data Firehose from data producers\.

The metrics that you configure for your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams and agents are automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch every five minutes\. Metrics are archived for two weeks; after that period, the data is discarded\.

The metrics collected for Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams are free of charge\. For information about Kinesis agent metrics, see [Monitoring Kinesis Agent Health](agent-health.md)\.
