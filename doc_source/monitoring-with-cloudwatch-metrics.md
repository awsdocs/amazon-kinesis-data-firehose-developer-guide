# Monitoring Kinesis Data Firehose Using CloudWatch Metrics<a name="monitoring-with-cloudwatch-metrics"></a>

Kinesis Data Firehose integrates with Amazon CloudWatch metrics so that you can collect, view, and analyze CloudWatch metrics for your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams\. For example, you can monitor the `IncomingBytes` and `IncomingRecords` metrics to keep track of data ingested into Kinesis Data Firehose from data producers\.

The metrics that you configure for your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams and agents are automatically collected and pushed to CloudWatch every five minutes\. Metrics are archived for two weeks; after that period, the data is discarded\.

The metrics collected for Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams are free of charge\. For information about Kinesis agent metrics, see [Monitoring Kinesis Agent Health](agent-health.md)\.

## Dynamic Partitioning CloudWatch Metrics<a name="dp-metrics-cw"></a>

If [dynamic partitioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/dynamic-partitioning.html) is enabled, the AWS/Firehose namespace includes the following metrics\. 


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- |

| PartitionCountExceeded |  This metric indicates if you are exceeding the partition count limit\. It emits 1 or 0 based on whether limit is breached or not\.  |

To filter metrics by delivery stream, use the `DeliveryStreamName` dimension\.

## Kinesis Data Firehose Usage Metrics<a name="fh-metrics-usage"></a>

You can use CloudWatch usage metrics to provide visibility into your account's usage of resources\. Use these metrics to visualize your current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards\. 

Service quota usage metrics are in the AWS/Usage namespace and are collected every minute\. 

Currently, the only metric name in this namespace that CloudWatch publishes is `ResourceCount`\. This metric is published with the dimensions `Service`, `Class`, `Type`, and `Resource`\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| ResourceCount |  The number of the specified resources running in your account\. The resources are defined by the dimensions associated with the metric\.  The most useful statistic for this metric is MAXIMUM, which represents the maximum number of resources used during the 1\-minute period\.   | 

The following dimensions are used to refine the usage metrics that are published by Kinesis Data Firehose\. 


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Service |  The name of the AWS service containing the resource\. For Kinesis Data Firehose usage metrics, the value for this dimension is `Firehose`\.   | 
| Class |  The class of resource being tracked\. Kinesis Data Firehose API usage metrics use this dimension with a value of `None`\.   | 
| Type |  The type of resource being tracked\. Currently, when the Service dimension is `Firehose`, the only valid value for Type is `Resource`\.   | 
| Resource |  The name of the AWS resource\. Currently, when the Service dimension is `Firehose`, the only valid value for Resource is `DeliveryStreams`\.   | 

## Accessing CloudWatch Metrics for Kinesis Data Firehose<a name="cloudwatch-metrics"></a>

You can monitor metrics for Kinesis Data Firehose using the CloudWatch console, command line, or CloudWatch API\. The following procedures show you how to access metrics using these different methods\. 

**To access metrics using the CloudWatch console**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. On the navigation bar, choose a region\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**\.

1. Choose the **Firehose** namespace\.

1. Choose **Delivery Stream Metrics** or **Firehose Metrics**\.

1. Select a metric to add to the graph\.

**To access metrics using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [list\-metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/list-metrics.html) and [get\-metric\-statistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/get-metric-statistics.html) commands\.

```
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/Firehose"
```

```
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace "AWS/Firehose" \
--metric-name DescribeDeliveryStream.Latency --statistics Average --period 3600 \
--start-time 2017-06-01T00:00:00Z --end-time 2017-06-30T00:00:00Z
```

## Best Practices with CloudWatch Alarms<a name="firehose-cloudwatch-metrics-best-practices"></a>

Add CloudWatch alarms for when the following metrics exceed the buffering limit \(a maximum of 15 minutes\): 
+ `DeliveryToS3.DataFreshness`
+ `DeliveryToSplunk.DataFreshness`
+ `DeliveryToAmazonOpenSearchService.DataFreshness`

Also, create alarms based on the following metric math expressions\.
+ `IncomingBytes (Sum per 5 Minutes) / 300` approaches a percentage of `BytesPerSecondLimit`\.
+ `IncomingRecords (Sum per 5 Minutes) / 300` approaches a percentage of `RecordsPerSecondLimit`\.
+ `IncomingPutRequests (Sum per 5 Minutes) / 300` approaches a percentage of `PutRequestsPerSecondLimit`\.

Another metric for which we recommend an alarm is `ThrottledRecords`\.

For information about troubleshooting when alarms go to the `ALARM` state, see [Troubleshooting Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](troubleshooting.md)\.
