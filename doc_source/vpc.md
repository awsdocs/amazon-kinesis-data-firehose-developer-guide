# Using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with AWS PrivateLink<a name="vpc"></a>

## Interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\) for Kinesis Data Firehose<a name="interface-vpc-endpoints"></a>

You can use an interface VPC endpoint to keep traffic between your Amazon VPC and Kinesis Data Firehose from leaving the Amazon network\. Interface VPC endpoints don't require an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection\. Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IPs in your Amazon VPC\. For more information, see [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html)\. 

## Using interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\) for Kinesis Data Firehose<a name="using-interface-vpc-endpoints"></a>

To get started, create an interface VPC endpoint in order for your Kinesis Data Firehose traffic from your Amazon VPC resources to start flowing through the interface VPC endpoint\. When you create an endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to Kinesis Data Firehose\. For more about using policies to control access from a VPC endpoint to Kinesis Data Firehose, see [Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html)\.

The following example shows how you can set up an AWS Lambda function in a VPC and create a VPC endpoint to allow the function to communicate securely with the Kinesis Data Firehose service\. In this example, you use a policy that allows the Lambda function to list the delivery streams in the current Region but not to describe any delivery stream\.

**Create a VPC endpoint**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the VPC Dashboard choose **Endpoints**\.

1. Choose **Create Endpoint**\.

1. In the list of service names, choose `com.amazonaws.your_region.kinesis-firehose`\.

1. Choose the VPC and one or more subnets in which to create the endpoint\.

1. Choose one or more security groups to associate with the endpoint\.

1. For **Policy**, choose **Custom** and paste the following policy:

   ```
   {
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "Allow-only-specific-PrivateAPIs",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": [
                   "firehose:ListDeliveryStreams"
               ],
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": [
                   "*"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Sid": "Allow-only-specific-PrivateAPIs",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": [
                   "firehose:DescribeDeliveryStream"
               ],
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Resource": [
                   "*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Create endpoint**\.

**Create an IAM role to use with the Lambda function**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the left pane, chose **Roles** and then choose **Create role**\.

1. Under **Select type of trusted entity**, leave the default selection **AWS service**\.

1. Under **Choose the service that will use this role**, choose **Lambda**\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. In the list of policies, search for and add the two policies named `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole` and `AmazonKinesisFirehoseReadOnlyAccess`\.
**Important**  
This is an example\. You might need stricter policies for your production environment\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\. You don't need to add tags for the purpose of this exercise\. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Enter a name for the role, then choose **Create role**\.

**Create a Lambda function inside the VPC**

1. Open the AWS Lambda console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/lambda/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/)\.

1. Choose **Create function**\.

1. Choose **Author from scratch**\.

1. Enter a name for the function, then set **Runtime** to Python 3\.6\.

1. Under **Permissions**, expand **Choose or create an execution role**\.

1. In the **Execution role** list, choose **Use an existing role**\.

1. In the **Existing role** list, choose the role you created above\.

1. Choose **Create function**\.

1. Under **Function code**, paste the following code\.

   ```
       import json
       import boto3
       import os
       from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
        
       def lambda_handler(event, context):
           REGION = os.environ['AWS_REGION']
           client = boto3.client(
               'firehose',
               REGION
               
           )
           print("Calling list_delivery_streams with ListDeliveryStreams allowed policy.")
           delivery_stream_request = client.list_delivery_streams()
           print("Successfully returned list_delivery_streams request %s." % (
               delivery_stream_request
           ))
           describe_access_denied = False
           try:
               print("Calling describe_delivery_stream with DescribeDeliveryStream denied policy.")
               delivery_stream_info = client.describe_delivery_stream(DeliveryStreamName='test-describe-denied')
           except ClientError as e:
               error_code = e.response['Error']['Code']
               print ("Caught %s." % (error_code))
               if error_code == 'AccessDeniedException':
                   describe_access_denied = True
           
           if not describe_access_denied:
               raise
           else:
               print("Access denied test succeeded.")
   ```

1. Under **Basic settings**, set the timeout to 1 minute\.

1. Under **Network**, choose the VPC where you created the endpoint above, then choose the subnets and security group that you associated with the endpoint when you created it\.

1. Near the top of the page, choose **Save**\.

1. Choose **Test**\.

1. Enter an event name, then choose **Create**\.

1. Choose **Test** again\. This causes the function to run\. After the execution result appears, expand **Details** and compare the log output to the function code\. Successful results show a list of the delivery streams in the Region, as well as the following output:

    Calling describe\_delivery\_stream\. 

    AccessDeniedException  

    Access denied test succeeded\.
